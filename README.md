# Addis-Pro-Django-Web-Application-Work-in-Progress-
**Overview**:

This project is a Django-based web application originally initiated as a practice collaboration. Although the original client request was uncertain and the project was left incomplete, I continued developing it as a way to strengthen my skills in Python and Django. The repository demonstrates my ability to structure a Django project, implement core features, and apply modern web development practices.

**Features Implemented:**

Django project setup with modular apps

User authentication (login, signup, logout)

Basic models for handling company data

Template rendering with Bootstrap for responsive design

Initial CRUD functionality for managing records

**Planned Features (Not Yet Completed, I doubt i will even complete them):**

Dashboard with analytics

Role-based access control

API endpoints for integration

Deployment setup (Heroku/Docker)

**Tech Stack:**

Backend: Python, Django

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

Database: SQLite (development)

Version Control: Git/GitHub

**Purpose:** This repository is part of my portfolio to showcase my growing expertise in Python development, Django framework, and web application design. Even though the project is unfinished, it reflects my ability to take initiative, learn independently, and build scalable foundations for future applications.
