# Addis Pro – Early Django Practice Project (Archived Work-in-Progress)
**Overview:** 

This repository contains one of my earliest experiments with Django, built several years ago when I was just beginning to explore web development. The project was never completed and the design is very rough, but I’ve kept it here as part of my learning journey. It shows my first attempts at structuring a Django application, experimenting with models, templates, and authentication, and gaining confidence with Python as a backend language.

**Features Attempted:**

Basic Django project setup with apps

Simple user authentication (login, signup)

Initial models for storing data

Early template rendering with HTML/CSS

**Limitations:**

The design is unfinished and not polished

Functionality is incomplete

Code reflects beginner-level understanding at the time

**Tech Stack:**

Backend: Python, Django

Frontend: HTML, CSS

Database: SQLite (development)

Version Control: Git/GitHub

**Purpose:** This project is archived as a record of my growth. While the website itself is not production-ready, it demonstrates my willingness to experiment, learn, and build with Django at an early stage. My current projects reflect much more advanced skills, but I keep this one to show where I started and how far I’ve come.
